<h1> Speech API Interest Group </h1>
<p> We are currently deciding what we 
want to do for the interest group, though we have a 
few different ideas.  We are considering the Google Speech API 
used for android programming, and also the Microsoft newly open-sourced 
Cortana API in windows 10.</p>
</hr>
<p> If we are to use the Google API we will be creating a choose your
own adventure app for the android store.  Otherwise we will be creating
a windows 10 app for creating code through speech to text commands.</p>
</hr>
<p> This interest group meets every Sunday at 4:00 at the V hall couches.</p>
