I am proposing that I create a working website for the ACM group on campus.  I am currently webmaster and have started the site though I havent done anything major.
I would be making pages for events and what has happened during past meetings.  I am not completely sure what this would completely encompass, but I can add extra functionality to the site as needed for the parameters for the projects.
For the first milestone I will show basic HTML text, on all pages.
For the second milestone I would use inline css in order to create more organized pages.
With php I planned on adding interactive forms for the users to input information into.
